Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
---

ES6 enables us to write JS in a more object-oriented manner. You may not always use object oriented programming, but is the most common way to write code in the industry.

The forming pillars of OOP are:
abstraction
encapsulation
inheritance
polymorphism

Abstraction allows us to hide complexity of a concept by giving us a 30,000 ft view of a concept

Encapsulation is hiding the details of how something works. The functionatility has been encapsulated so we dont have to worry about the specifics of the functionality

Inheritance allows onjects to inherit properities and functionality from other classes (parent or base classes)

Polymorphism means that someting can take multiple different forms.

We can use classes to group code together in a logical way to represent objects. Classes are like blue prints for onjects to be created from.

An object is an instance of a class.

You can think of classes as like the blueprint for building a house and the house is an instance of that blueprint, so the house represents an object.

Classes

Classes allow us to group proteries and functionality together.

In classes the first letter of each word is capitalized. Classes are not camel cased.

a method is a function that belongs to an object (class)

each class should be in charge of one thing, each class has its own specific role

use the new keyword to create an instance of a class (intanciation)# week5
